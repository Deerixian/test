        <p id="description">Hello! I am Dominik and what you are currently looking at is my own personal website of projects that I have worked on in my AP Computer Science Principles class.</p>

        <h1 id="header">Why Computer Science?</h1>
        <p id="description">When I was young, I did have some interest in technology, and had wondered how it actually worked, which led to me taking AP Computer Science Principles. While I still have more to learn, I would not have been able to make this site without the knowledge I gained from this class.</p>

        <h1 id="header">Other Stuff</h1>
        <p id="description">Outside of this class, I mostly just spend my time either listening to music or playing video games, mainly on Steam. My favorite story game as of right now would be Suits: Absolute Power, for several different reasons. I would absolutely recommend this game to everyone.</p>
